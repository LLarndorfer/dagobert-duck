                Donald duck is a bit of a hothead and often has money problems and bad luck.
                He tries different jobs, but they don't always work out. Sometimes he works at his uncle
                Dagobert Duck's margarine factory.
                <br> <br>
                Donald likes to relax and doesn't work too hard.
                He really cares about his girlfriend, Daisy Duck, but they never get married.
                His cousin, Gustav Gans, competes with him for Daisy's attention, making things a bit complicated.
                <br><br>
                Donald's main problems are Gustav, who always seems lucky, and his rich uncle, Dagobert Duck.
                Donald often borrows money from Dagobert, who uses it to make Donald do things for him.
                Dagobert promises to leave his money to Donald, keeping him doing tasks or protecting him
                on adventures.
